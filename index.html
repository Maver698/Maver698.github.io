 <h1>Madison Avery</h1>
 <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>

 <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying communication with a
minor in theatre. I work at Rodeheaver in the makeup department for theatrical productions.</p>
 <p>
 I am active in my
local church: Faith Baptist Church in Taylors, SC. I help my parents teach children's church, and I used to help out with the Bible Quizzing ministry.
 </p>
 <p>
 I also enjoy singing, art, animals, and playing board and card games with my family.
